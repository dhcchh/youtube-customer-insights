U can see how much dirt/coffee grounds  will come out while descaling ur machine. After descaling & rinsing were done, I removed all the parts of coffee machine again, washed and left them for drying completely. Also unplugged coffee machine, wiped with clean cloth where I can reach. Left it open like for next couple hours. Believe me ur machine will thank u for that and u will also enjoy that fresh/tasty coffee taste.
