What's the problem with having more buttons??? Now I realized I like buttons!!! I miss them on the vertuo pop!! 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅,Neutral,0.40920794010162354,,
Just got mine out of the box and prepared a coffee. Now I'm unsuccessfully trying to empty the machine system. I will presume the system is already empty! Hope not f... it up!!!,Neutral,0.4202965497970581,,
"Just got mine out of the box but I'm thinking Nespresso purposely makes it seem complicated as a marketing strategy.  Like you've purchased a Mercedes.  The accent is priceless too!!! Like going to the Mac store 15 years ago.  Also, there are so many types from different companies the whole thing is ridiculous even though the coffee truthfully tastes great",Positive,0.432477742433548,,

Where are all these used pods coming from when all you're doing is cleaning your nespresso.,Negative,0.53926020860672,,
"This is ridiculous so here it goes,

1.Turn machine on.
2.Once heating cycle is over, open and close but not lock.
3.Hold button for 7 seconds(you have 45secs to do it).
4.Lock and unlock.
5. Hold button for 7 secs.
6.Lock and push the coffe button.
7.After the descaling is done, run a cleaning cycle.(By locking and once its heated press 3 times in 2 seconds).



you're very welcome. Pura Vida.",Neutral,0.5404829382896423,,
"I just did the descaling via the cleaning mode and used descaling solution. Empty it all, clean water and descaling solution in tank. Lock machine, press button 3 times quickly, let it run. Repeated process until all solution water ran through, then filled tank with clean water and repeated until full tank was used. Way easier than the descaling mode.",Neutral,0.5551245212554932,,

"3:18  Last part of Descaling, I went with the procedure all well then when i reached the rinse cycle, 
the machine never stopped pouring water and it never stopped by itself, I kept pouring water in it and it kept going for 1 hour. Is this normal? I had to pause it",Neutral,0.585245668888092,,

"I just finished descaling my Vertuo Pop machine. Used regular 1/4 cup 5% acidity white vinegar for full water tank instead of Nespresso descaling chemicals. However, followed all the instructions. It makes more sense if u follow the instructions while u doing it like if u cleaning/descaling or emptying whatever ur machine needs. U can see how much dirt/coffee grounds  will come out while descaling ur machine. After descaling & rinsing were done, I removed all the parts of coffee machine again, washed and left them for drying completely. Also unplugged coffee machine, wiped with clean cloth where I can reach. Left it open like for next couple hours. Believe me ur machine will thank u for that and u will also enjoy that fresh/tasty coffee taste. 
Update after 2.5 hours: My coffee tastes amazing. No taste of vinegar at all or that weird taste before descaling. The process is super easy, highly recommend doing it every 5-6 weeks at least. Just follow the instructions along while u doing it.",Neutral,0.6479454636573792,,
