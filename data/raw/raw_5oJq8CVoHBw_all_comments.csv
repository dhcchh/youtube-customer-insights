The video misses to pinpoint/emphasize what to expect after pushing the button (which is  so easy & logical to just show and avoid missteps). It should be a very, very simple process but the (brit) demonstrator added so many questions while following the video . We have had nothing but trouble with our machine (error codes) and plan to get rid of it (this brand) - the coffee quality this machine makes is very good but when it is working. Judging from the short 1-yr warranty that comes with the machine, we realize how expensive each cup of coffee ends up being (not to include the downtime & frustration). Also, the pods are SUPER-expensive compared to other machines' alternatives (for same coffee brewing quality). For sure, this company have excelled in one part of their business: impeccable marketing!.... but that does not add value to the product or customers' life quality (imho).",0,2025-05-29T15:33:31Z,2025-05-29T15:33:31Z

It makes more sense if u follow the instructions while u doing it like if u cleaning/descaling or emptying whatever ur machine needs. U can see how much dirt/coffee grounds  will come out while descaling ur machine. After descaling & rinsing were done, I removed all the parts of coffee machine again, washed and left them for drying completely. Also unplugged coffee machine, wiped with clean cloth where I can reach. Left it open like for next couple hours. Believe me ur machine will thank u for that and u will also enjoy that fresh/tasty coffee taste. 
Update after 2.5 hours: My coffee tastes amazing. No taste of vinegar at all or that weird taste before descaling. The process is super easy, highly recommend doing it every 5-6 weeks at least. Just follow the instructions along while u doing it.",17,2025-03-01T16:27:54Z,2025-03-01T22:08:48Z

2. I like how the video tells you that your machine lets you know when you need descaling by blinking three times orange, before solid white. But in the video, they show it blinking three times white, not orange, so which one is it?

3. Do you have to unlock it and lock it twice, like in the video, just to descale? Lol. Or were they simply showing you how to unlock, but you only need to do it once and then hold 7 seconds?

Not the clearest video in these respects.",0,2023-12-18T06:34:00Z,2023-12-18T06:35:12Z

Machine had to be sent away to be fixed and it only 3 months old. Parts were replaced. Same problem yet again now for a 2nd time, a month after being ""fixed"". Last time they sent a temporary one while other being fixed. Set delivery date but they came day before. When temp one eventually arrived the water tank was smashed / broken. My own machine it came back was in blink mode. I had to call nespresso and they talked me through steps. Why didnt their engineer have it back on white light? Machine worked for about 4 weeks before needing another descale. A week after that descale it stopped working again. Wont go into cleaning mode at all. Very time consuming and complicated descaling . Ive owned 3 coffee machines and this one is a) unreliable, and b) poor customer service. No apology for machine being returend on blink mode.
